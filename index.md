## Welcome to covidsim's documentation!

To add documentation, you can edit the markdown files or add new ones. You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/josephpb/covidmodelling/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to do it, vim, or a specialised program like Typora.

All documentation should be kept in the gh-pages branch. Whenever you push to this branch, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the doc pages with the new modifications. 

The current theme being used is [just-the-docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs). Refer to the website for documentation.

To preview the website locally, you need to install [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and the remote-theme plugin,

```
gem install jekyll-remote-theme
```

then the website can be build with

```
jekyll build
```

and you can run

```
jekyll serve
```
to start a server serving the website, which you can then access at localhost:4000 by default.
