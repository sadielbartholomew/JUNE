Geographic Information
========
We use datasets extracted from Census information recorded in 2011 and managed by [Nomis](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/). The datasets contain informations based on "Usual residents", defined as anyone who, on census day, was in the UK and had stayed or intended to stay in the UK for a period of 12 months or more, or had a permanent UK address and was outside the UK and intended to be outside the UK for less than 12 months.

The dataset is subdivided in different type of areas,

- Postcode Sectors, correspond to the first four characters of the postode (e.g. DH1 1)
 - Output Areas, are the smallest geographic unit for which outputs are published.
